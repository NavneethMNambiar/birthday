        Sruthy,
Ofcourse you'd be thinking why would anyone do so much for someone they met barely couple of days back? 
Is it love? Or is this a joke? Onnum angott mansalavunundavila.
Enikk oraalod samsarikkumbo, I get to understand a lot more about them. And let me be straight, I honestly feel that you are such an amazing soul. Ne ennod thurann paranja orupaad sangadangal, athinte aazham ethra unden I could relate to a small extent. I believe today's world has lost its purity, be it in love, compassion or understanding. We see good people suffer and bad ones live a perfect life. From what see of you, I understand that not a lot of them understand things that actually matters to you. Indeed it is easy to love, but being loved is a blessing. We met as strangers and I hope we are good friends, and no matter what life has kept for us tomorrow, even if we turn out to be in the extreme dimensions of the map, I want you to always remember that there's always, atleast me, as a well-wisher of yours, throughout your life from here.
Look around, during your best of times, and you will see everyone, even people that hate you be there for you. On the contrast, if at a point you badly want someone to talk, Or to throw up, or lend a shoulder, or atleast to just be there, reach out and I promise I'll be there. Even if theres nothing that i can possibly do about it, I definitely got your back no matter what. 
Inspite of my bad health or having to write my university exam tomorrow, if i am writing this to you, if I developed the website for you, may the effort be little or admirable, ini angott, you'll never be an aorta less important than you are right now for me. 
Tomorrow indeed is a mystery, we may even be separated forever, but remember that you matter, you always did, and that you're good enough I believe, even if you feel unimportant. 
I honestly want to see you in flying colours, living a much happier life which i believe you deserve the most, sooner or later, with or without me. Grateful to meet such a wonderful personality i believe. I wouldnt ask you to trust me, or to keep attachments, or any commitments between us, onnum venam en ila. Just promise me you'll always be happy, and never let anything or anyone take you down. May this be the day, where you draw a boundary to your entire past, and restart towards a brighter colourful life ahead, for which I would always be a good friend. Happiest birthday to you <3.</section>
